## Item generation

After content validation but prior to settling on 4 candidate items per 3x3 condition, there was a dearth of items within some of the Affective, Cognitive, or Behavioral item groupings. We generated additional candidates at this point and have these items [located here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whB4Ve4aDDl3bxx3dIlloouTDy1ScCcxrT3gK6s9DyU/edit?usp=sharing) (Montclair State University e-mail needed to access). It was from this larger list of (reduced) candidate items that the 36 pilot candidates were identified (and in some cases modified, edited, or otherwise further crafted)


## Content Validation {#CValid}

```{r contentvalidation, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

cvalid <- read.csv("Engagement Survey Content Validity.csv")

items <- nrow(cvalid)

```

7 Eagle I.O consultants were twice instructed to place each of `r items` items into one of three categories: Absorption, Dedication, or Vigor, and Cognitive, Affective, or Behavioral. Instructions asked each rater to:

> INSTRUCTIONS: Place an "X" in the column that you feel is the best fit for each item (only one "X" per row please)

The substantive scale definitions provided for ratings were: 

+ *Absorption*: Being fully immersed in oneâ€™s work, where time passes quickly and one has difficulty detaching from work tasks
+ *Vigor*: Experiencing persistent levels of energy, effort, and enthusiasm while working
+ *Dedication*: Experiencing pride and challenge in ones work, as well as strong feelings of support from and loyalty toward the organization

The attitudinal scale definitions were:

+ *Cognitive*: Pertaining to thoughts or general mental processes (for example what someone thinks)
+ *Affective*: Pertaining to feelings or emotions (for example, how someone feels)
+ *Behavioral*: Pertaining to acts or actions (for example, what someone does) 

The goal was to identify item(s) that were equally and heavily implicated with one substantive and one attitudinal scale.

```{r absorption, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
## Absorption

table(cvalid[,c(6,2)])
table(cvalid[,c(6,3)])
table(cvalid[,c(6,4)])
```

```{r vigor, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
## Vigor

table(cvalid[,c(7,2)])
table(cvalid[,c(7,3)])
table(cvalid[,c(7,4)])
```

```{r dedication, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
## Dedication

table(cvalid[,c(8,2)])
table(cvalid[,c(8,3)])
table(cvalid[,c(8,4)])
```
