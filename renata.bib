	abstract = {Web surveys have become increasingly central to innovation research but often suffer from low response rates. Based on a cost–benefits framework and the explicit consideration of heterogeneity across respondents, we consider the effects of key contact design features such as personalization, incentives, and the exact timing of survey contacts on web survey response rates. We also consider the benefits of a “dynamic strategy”, i.e., the approach to change features of survey contacts over the survey life cycle. We explore these effects experimentally using a career survey sent to over 24,000 junior scientists and engineers. The results show that personalization increases the odds of responding by as much as 48\%, while lottery incentives with a high payoff and a low chance of winning increase the odds of responding by 30\%. Furthermore, changing the wording of reminders over the survey life cycle increases the odds of a response by over 30\%, while changes in contact timing (day of the week or hour of the day) did not have significant benefits. Improvements in response rates did not come at the expense of lower data quality. Our results provide novel insights into web survey response behavior and suggest useful tools for innovation researchers seeking to increase survey participation.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This study expands upon existing knowledge of response rates by conducting a large-scale quantitative review of published response rates. This allowed a fine-grained comparison of response rates across respondent groups. Other unique features of this study are the analysis of response enhancing techniques across respondent groups and response rate trends over time. In order to aid researchers in designing surveys, we provide expected response rate percentiles for different survey modalities. Design: We analyzed 2,037 surveys, covering 1,251,651 individual respondents, published in 12 journals in I/O Psychology, Management, and Marketing during the period 1995–2008. Expected response rate levels were summarized for different types of respondents and use of response enhancing techniques was coded for each study. Findings: First, differences in mean response rate were found across respondent types with the lowest response rates reported for executive respondents and the highest for non-working respondents and non-managerial employees. Second, moderator analyses suggested that the effectiveness of response enhancing techniques was dependent on type of respondents. Evidence for differential prediction across respondent type was found for incentives, salience, identification numbers, sponsorship, and administration mode. When controlling for increased use of response enhancing techniques, a small decline in response rates over time was found. Implications: Our findings suggest that existing guidelines for designing effective survey research may not always offer the most accurate information available. Survey researchers should be aware that they may obtain lower/ higher response rates depending on the respondent type surveyed and that some response enhancing techniques may be less/more effective in specific samples. Originality/value: This study, analyzing the largest set of published response rates to date, offers the first evidence for different response rates and differential functioning of response enhancing techniques across respondent types.

	abstract = {This study explored the perceptions of an employee’s manager as coach behaviour and the relationship to their perceived work engagement. The Measurement Model of Coaching Skills ({MMCS}) by Park and colleagues and the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale ({UWES}) were used as the tools to measure this relationship. The {MMCS} was also validated further in this study as there is limited psychometric data on this tool in the literature unlike the {UWES}. A total of 195 {MBA} students with work experience responded to the survey out of a possible 493 students. The results demonstrate a positive significant relationship between the respondents’ perceptions of their manager’s coaching behaviour and their own perceived work engagement. The {MMCS} also demonstrated acceptable psychometric properties, however, sub-scales failed discriminant validity. Most likely this is due to the difficulty in separating out discrete functions of the coaching role. As a result the composite score for the {MMCS} is recommended. The results add to the literature noting the benefits managerial coaching can have on organizational performance measures. Further development of managers is needed to enable them to become effective coaches as demonstrated by the below average result. ({PsycINFO} Database Record (c) 2019 {APA}, all rights reserved)},

	abstract = {Work engagement as a predictor of health is an emerging concept in occupational science and the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale ({UWES}) is the most popular work engagement measurement tool. However, despite its popularity, the {UWES} is not free from controversy concerning its factorial validity. In this paper, 21 research studies on both {UWES}-9 and {UWES}-17 factorial validity within the confirmatory factor analysis ({CFA}) approach have been reviewed in order to answer the question as to which of the {UWES} factorial structures displays greater validity. The originally proposed threefactor structure of the {UWES} has been recognized as superior in 6 studies. In further 6 studies, the {UWES} structure with 1 general factor has been found to be superior. In 8 studies, the authors have concluded that the one- and three-factor structures could be considered equivalent. One study has failed to confirm either the one- or three-factor structure of the {UWES}. These ambiguous results from studies focusing on the {UWES} factorial validity are puzzling because they not only indicate a lack of validity for the {UWES} as a measurement tool but might also challenge the whole concept of work engagement as a three-factor structure of dedication, vigor and absorption.

Methods: A total of 702 women, originally recruited as a general population of 7–15- year-old girls in 1995 for a longitudinal study, completed the {UWES}-9. Exploratory factor analysis ({EFA}) was performed on half the sample, and {CFA} on the other half. Results: Exploratory factor analysis showed that a one-factor structure best fit the data. {CFA} with three different models (one-factor, two-factor, and three-factor) was then conducted. Goodness-of-fit statistics showed poor fit for all three models, with {RMSEA} never going lower than 0.166. Conclusion: Despite indication from exploratory factor analysis ({EFA}) that a one-factor structure seemed to fit the data, we were unable to find good model fit for a one-, two-, or three-factor model using {CFA}. As previous studies have also failed to reach conclusive results on the optimal factor structure for the {UWES}-9, further research is needed in order to disentangle the possible effects of gender, nationality and occupation on work engagement.

Paradigm” as a novel variant of  tripartite model of
attitudes. The Campbell Paradigm is based on a highly restricted measurement
model that speaks of a compensatory relation between a person’s latent
attitude and the costs that come with any specific behavior. It overcomes the
overarching weakness of the original tripartite model (i.e., its relative
irrelevance for actual behavior) and offers a parsimonious explanation for
behavior. Even though this seems attractive, we also discuss why the paradigm
has not gained momentum in the 50 years since it was originally proposed
by Donald T. Campbell. To demonstrate the paradigm’s suitability even
when implemented with an unrefined instrument in a domain where it has not been
used previously, we apply the paradigm to a classic data example from attitude
research from the 1984 {US} presidential election to account for the
electorate’s voting intentions and actual voting behaviors.},
