# Analyses

![](results.jpg)

bifactor analysis are most commonly applied in the exploration of common method variance [see, for example, @reise_rediscovery_2012;  @rodriguez_evaluating_2016]. @giordano_exploratory_2020 provide an overview regarding past and potential applications of *exploratory* bifactor analysis and cite @reise_rediscovery_2012 as an influential impetus for the resurgence of bifactor models in general. 

```{r data, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}

temp <- read.csv("qualtrics_pilot_data.csv", header=FALSE)

x <- temp[2,]
data <- temp[-c(1:3),]
colnames(data) <- x

num <- nrow(data)

```

## Pilot analyses

`r num` people responded. Probably need to further screen for duration. This is the number of seconds to complete the entire survey (according to communications with Qualtrics in early December).

### Classical test theory

+ corrected item-total correlations and alphas by condition

### Confirmatory factor analyses

#### Multigroup analyses

+ using experimental condition as "multiple groups" (measurement invariance)

#### Bifactor analyses

+ looking at dual structure

### Summary

Recommendation for final instrument based on consideration of all of the above pieces of evidence

## Construct and Criterion-related Validation

Use Gallup for construct validation [@thackray_gallup_2005; @harter_relationship_2013]. Also the Utrecht Work Engagement Scale [UWES; @schaufeli_measurement_2002; @schaufeli_defining_2010]
